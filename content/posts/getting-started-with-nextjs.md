# Getting Started with Next.js 🚀

Welcome to your journey into **Next.js**, the powerful React framework for building fast, scalable web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a full-stack framework built on top of React that enables features like:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- File-based routing
- Built-in image optimization

## Why Use Next.js?

Here are a few reasons developers love it:

- ⚡ **Performance**: Pages are fast by default.
- 🧠 **Developer Experience**: Zero-config, helpful error messages, and built-in tooling.
- 🌐 **SEO-Friendly**: Pre-rendering means content is crawlable by search engines.
- 🔄 **Hybrid Rendering**: Choose SSR, SSG, or ISR per page.

## Project Setup

To start a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
